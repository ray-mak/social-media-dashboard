<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This is the second challenge I've done with React. It is a social media dashboard used to track follower/view changes. I decided to attempt this challenge since it had some reusable card components. Furthermore, there is a darkmode function that I was able to implement. I felt it was a good opportunity to practice writing functions in addition to reusing components with React.</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

<h1>My Process</h1>
<p>My process with React is a bit similar to my usual approach. I try to set up the layout of the page first. With React I have to build out the components in seperate text documents and import/export them. However, the actual code and design is quite similar to normal HTML and CSS. After writing components for desktop, I'll make it mobile responsive. Then I'll work on the functions when all the styling and layouts are done.</p>

<h2>Built With</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>React</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>I learned about useState and useEffect. This was a good opportunity to put it into practice by combining that with localStorage to toggle the darkmode function.</p>
